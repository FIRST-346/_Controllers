 * NormalizationMixer a mixer norrmalizer
 * 
 * This class takes n MixOutputs and normalizes their outputs so that the
 * Highest output (Over 100%) gets scaled down to 100% and the remaining controllers get scaled down an equal percentage
 * 
 * This is accomplished by first finding the highest output over 100% and setting that as the denominator of the
 * percentage.
 * 
 * Consider the following:
 * Assume 2 MixOutputs
 * MixOutput 1 is set to 1.1 (110%)
 * MixOutput 2 is set to .5 (50%)
 * 
 * Because you cannot output more power then you have you need to scale your outputs to be proportional
 * to the highest value (as long as its over 100%)
 * 
 * MixOutput 1 is scaled to 100% by taking 1.1 and dividing it by 1.1
 * MixOutput 2 is scaled to 45.45(bar)% by taking .5 and dividing it by 1.1
 * 
 * MixOutput1 => 1.1/1.1
 * MixOutput2 => 0.5/1.1
 *
